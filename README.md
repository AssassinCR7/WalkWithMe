# WalkWithMe
n this we are planning to make an application in which you need to just enter your name and the time when you start coding... It will track your everything and have  features like: 1. Give you reminders after some particular time to:- A. have some water(which we generally forget) B. Close your eyes for 5 min(give rest to them). C. Puzzle time (in this we provide you some puzzles for instances like in sheet we have gfg puzzle) D. It will also notify you after some time to read article or get informed about the world( related to your interest), we web scrap the topics like news, entertainment, article etc for you E. I know we all get bored after a time so get your mind out of any pressure or frustration we also provide you some game links(small online games) , which definately refresh your mind.  2. Another important feature which we are thinking of is some window time tracker... We are not consistent in what we are doing and along with important things we open up whatsapp, Facebook, Netflix and all and later on think that we study for straight 5-6 hours. So this will help to record the time you spend on rach windows and later give you the track record that you open up that many windows and for that much time.
