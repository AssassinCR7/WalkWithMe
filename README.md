                    ##**WHAT IS THIS?**##
In this we are planning to develop a chrome extension which is basically designed with objective to increase the productivity of Now or Never by providing some external sources to refresh the mind along with reminder which reminds you for water intake.
It will have features like: 

1. Give you reminder after some particular time(which is set by you) to have a glass of water.

2. It will also provide you the latest news of the world or your country based on your interest.

3. we also added a feature that sometimes we want to keep ourself distract from what we are currently doing and engage our mind in something else so we added puzzles.

4. Another feature include a game which will definately refresh you. 

5. we will extend it further by adding more features, one of them includes to track the website time from the time you press start till you press end and later provide you stats about of all your time.
